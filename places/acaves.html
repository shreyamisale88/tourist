                The Ajanta Caves are a group of 29 Buddhist cave temples in Ajanta, India. Some of the caves even date back to the 2nd century BC. These caves display a fusion of both Theravada and Mahayana Buddhist traditions and have some of the best masterpieces of Buddhist art in the country. Colourful murals and statues associated to the life of Buddha and various Bodhisattvas along with everyday scenes with meaningful inscriptions can be seen in these caves on the walls. Ajanta Caves and the nearby Ellora Caves are often explored by tourists together on a tour.

            <h2>HISTORY OF THE ATTRACTION</h2>
            <p>
                The Ajanta caves have been the storage of history in India from the 2nd century onwards. The period of the south rulerâ€™s Satavahanas and the later periods have specially made Ajanta a gallery of paintings, architecture, inscriptions and Buddhist religion and educational centres. The caves have served as a reservoir for many historical records from which we understand the culture of India.

                <p>
                    If a person is travelling by flight they would want to reach Aurangabad first as it is the closest airport to the caves and from there they can board a bus or a taxi to the historical destination. If a person is likely to travel by train, then they can board a train that drops them at the Bhusaval or Jalgaon stations from where on, the travellers can avail the state transport buses or taxi to reach the caves.
