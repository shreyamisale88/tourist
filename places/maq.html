                5 kilometer off the roads of the Aurangabad city stands the colossal beauty, and the most impressive monument of Aurangabad - Bibi Ka Maqbara, which bears a strong resemblance to the iconic Taj Mahal in Agra. It is mainly a mausoleum marking the burial ground of Aurangzeb's wife, Rabia-Durrani. Aurangzeb started constructing the Bibi Ka Maqbara, but it was his son Prince Azam Shah who completed its construction. One of the most perfectly proportioned and captivating Mughal mausoleums, the structure of Bibi Ka Maqbara, which brings together Persian and Mughal elements, was designed and erected by Ata-ullah, an architect, and Hanspat Rai, an engineer respectively. Ata-ullah was the son of Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the main designer of the Taj Mahal.

                Like Taj Mahal, Bibi Ka Maqbara too is located amidst a manicured garden with axial ponds, fountains, and water channels, and lined with broad pathways. The garden is further enclosed by high crenelated walls with fortress set at intervals, and open pavilions on three sides. The mausoleum is built in a Charbagh style on a raised platform to be reached by a fleet of stairs. Its distinctive interiors are also a class apart. To reach the main octagonal chamber containing the unadorned grave, one needs to descend the flight of stairs. The grave is enclosed in a perforated marble screens. The chamber above is a high square structure presenting identical facades on four sides.
